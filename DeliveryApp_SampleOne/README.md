# Salesforce DX Project: Next Steps

Now that you’ve created a Salesforce DX project, what’s next? Here are some documentation resources to get you started.

## How Do You Plan to Deploy Your Changes?

Do you want to deploy a set of changes, or create a self-contained application? Choose a [development model](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/user-guide/development-models).

## Configure Your Salesforce DX Project

The `sfdx-project.json` file contains useful configuration information for your project. See [Salesforce DX Project Configuration](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_ws_config.htm) in the _Salesforce DX Developer Guide_ for details about this file.

**********************
Important PTO:
    This app was originally created to map with org Sysvine - DeliveryAppSystemOne
    Then lots of hindrances came... one main thing is 
    " Verify Account " of a scratch org is clickable only once. It occurs after every developer org creation
    Problem: 
        Microsoft outlook and Apple Mail significantly opens the this link after email is sent for verification 
        This makes the link invalid when opened in Microsoft outlook and Apple Mail...

    Hence keeping this org as such...
